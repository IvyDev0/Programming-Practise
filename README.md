# PRACTICE-makes-perfect
#### Pratice in C++



12/05/2016:
I got two chances for interview of Google and Hulu.
Last year I failed for Google because of weakness in algorithm, for that I even didn't know what is dynamic programming.
After studying algorithm course in the third grade, and some days figuring the problems on leetcode......
I didn't performed well for the past one hour during the phone interview of Hulu, because of forgetting how to wirte the class for single direction linked list.

However, I clearly understand that memorizing things in a fixed way is not the solution. 
I failed to design a classfor linked list because that I never considered this kind of manual design question, I never think like a real computer scientist, though I'm trying to think from the principle level of compiler and machine learning course and raise a lot interest.


Nevertheless, the practice on my way to becoming a qualified computer engineer now begins.
I forked [Google Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university) and started daily plan.
